name = input("What's your name? -")
print( "hello," , name)


# How to add more commas in commas
 print ("hello,"friend"") #Wrong way
print("hello,\"Friend\"")
OUTPUT - hello,"Friend"

#Another way to print variable in the comma:
print(f"hello, {name}")
Output- hello, Jayant


# REmove white spaces From str and  capitalise the fist letter
name - name.strip().title()

************{Example -# ask user for their name
name = input("What's your name? -")

# REmove white spaces From str and  capitalise the fist letter
name - name.strip().title()

print(f"hello, {name}")

*At terminal 
What's your name? -      jayant chaudhary     
hello, Jayant Chaudhary}****************************

#Or we can just directly written this in one line
name = input("What's your name? -").strip().title()
print( "hello," , name)

*************************FLOAT**************************************
A floating point value is a real number that has a decimal point in it, such as 0.52.

Let’s imagine, however, that you want to round the total to the nearest integer.
Looking at the Python documentation for round, you’ll see that the available arguments are round(number[n, ndigits]). 
Those square brackets indicate that something optional can be specified by the programmer. 
Therefore, you could do round(n) to round a digit to its nearest integer. 
Alternatively, you could code as follows:


# Get the user's input
x = float(input("What's x? "))
y = float(input("What's y? "))


Let’s imagine that we want to round this down. We could modify our code as follows:

# Get the user's input
x = float(input("What's x? "))
y = float(input("What's y? "))

# Calculate the result and round
z = round(x / y, 2)

# Print the result
print(z)
As we might expect, this will round the result to the nearest two decimal points.

We could also use fstring to format the output as follows:

# Get the user's input
x = float(input("What's x? "))
y = float(input("What's y? "))

# Calculate the result
z = x / y

# Print the result
print(f"{z:.2f}")
This cryptic fstring code displays the same as our prior rounding strategy.

You can learn more in Python’s documentation of float.

Def
# Create a rounded result
z = round(x + y)

# Print the result
print(z)
